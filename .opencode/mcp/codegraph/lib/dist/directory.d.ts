 * one `.codegraph/` — most concretely Windows-native and WSL (issue #636). The
 * daemon lockfile (`.codegraph/daemon.pid`) records a platform-specific pid and
 * socket path (a Windows named pipe vs a WSL Unix socket), and SQLite file
 * locking across the WSL2 ↔ Windows filesystem boundary is unreliable, so two
 * daemons sharing one index risks corruption. Setting `CODEGRAPH_DIR=.codegraph-win`
 * on one side gives each environment its own index in the same tree.
 *
 * Read live (not captured at load) so it is both process-accurate and testable.
 * An override that isn't a plain directory name — empty, containing a path
 * separator, `.`, `..`/traversal, or absolute — is ignored (we keep the
 * default) rather than risk writing the index outside the project or into the
 * project root itself; we warn once to stderr so the misconfiguration is seen.
