/**
 * SQLite Adapter
 *
 * Thin wrapper over Node's built-in `node:sqlite` (`DatabaseSync`), exposed
 * through a small better-sqlite3-shaped interface so the rest of the codebase
 * is storage-agnostic.
 *
 * CodeGraph ships with a bundled Node runtime, so `node:sqlite` (real SQLite,
 * with WAL + FTS5) is always available — there is no native build step and no
 * wasm fallback. When run from source instead, it requires Node >= 22.5.
