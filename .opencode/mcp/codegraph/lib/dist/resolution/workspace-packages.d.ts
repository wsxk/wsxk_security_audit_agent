/**
 * JS/TS workspace (monorepo) package resolution.
 *
 * npm / yarn / bun read member packages from the root `package.json`
 * `workspaces` field; pnpm from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. A cross-package
 * import like `@scope/ui/widgets` is LOCAL to the monorepo, but to a
 * single-package resolver it looks exactly like a third-party npm
 * specifier — so `isExternalImport` flags it external and the
 * consumer↔definition edge is never created. For component barrels
 * (`export { default as X } from './x.svelte'`) that surfaces as a false
 * `0 callers` on a live component (issue #629).
 *
 * This module maps each member package's declared `name` to its
 * directory so the resolver can rewrite `@scope/ui/widgets` →
 * `packages/ui/widgets` and then run normal extension/index resolution.
 *
 * Scope deliberately small for v1 (mirrors path-aliases.ts):
 *   - reads `workspaces` (array OR `{ packages: [...] }`) from package.json,
 *     plus a minimal `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `packages:` list
 *   - expands one level of `*` / `**` globs (`packages/*`, `apps/*`)
 *   - subpath resolution is directory-based (`@scope/ui/sub` → `<ui>/sub`);
 *     it does NOT yet honour a member's `exports` map or `main` field
 *   - returns null when the project declares no workspaces, so single-
 *     package repos pay nothing and see no behaviour change.
