/**
 * Process supervision for long-running CLI commands (`index` / `init --index`).
 *
 * Indexing a large repo can run for a while on the main thread, and #999
 * surfaced two ways that goes wrong when nothing is watching it:
 *
 *   1. **Orphaned worker.** `index` runs in a child re-exec'd with
 *      `--liftoff-only` (the WASM-flag relaunch). Its parent blocks in
 *      `spawnSync`, so when the parent shim is killed it cannot forward the
 *      signal — the child keeps running, now orphaned, pinning a core. The PPID
 *      watchdog (#277) notices the parent/host went away and exits the child.
 *   2. **Wedged indexer.** The `#850` main-thread liveness watchdog — which
 *      SIGKILLs a process whose event loop stops turning — was wired only into
 *      the MCP `serve` path, so a wedged `index`/`init` was never auto-killed.
 *
 * Both reuse the exact mechanisms `serve` already uses; this just makes them
 * available to a one-shot command. Best-effort and self-disabling: a missing
 * watchdog never blocks the command from running. Both honour the same env
 * switches as `serve` (`CODEGRAPH_NO_WATCHDOG`, `CODEGRAPH_PPID_POLL_MS=0`).
