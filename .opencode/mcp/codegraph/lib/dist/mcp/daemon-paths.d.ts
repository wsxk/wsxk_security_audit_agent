/**
 * Daemon socket + lockfile path helpers — issue #411.
 *
 * One shared `codegraph serve --mcp` daemon per project root means we need a
 * stable, project-keyed rendezvous between cooperating processes. The IPC
 * surface area is just two file paths:
 *
 *   - `daemon.sock` — Unix domain socket / named pipe the daemon listens on.
 *   - `daemon.pid` — atomic-create lockfile holding the daemon's pid + version.
 *
 * Both live under `.codegraph/` so the project-scoped uninstall (`codegraph
 * uninit`) sweeps them up for free.
 *
 * Special-case: Unix domain socket paths have a hard length limit (~104 on
 * macOS, ~108 on Linux); when the in-project path exceeds it we fall back to
 * an absolute-path hash under `os.tmpdir()`. The pidfile always stays in the
 * project (it doesn't have a length limit) — and acts as the authoritative
 * pointer to the socket path the daemon chose.
 *
 * Second special-case (#997, #974): some filesystems can't host an AF_UNIX node
 * AT ALL — ExFAT/FAT external volumes, certain network mounts, WSL2 DrvFs — so
 * `listen()` throws ENOTSUP/EACCES regardless of path length. We can't cheaply
 * tell those apart from a normal volume up front, so instead of guessing we
 * expose an ORDERED candidate list (`getDaemonSocketCandidates`): the in-project
 * path first, the deterministic tmpdir path as the fallback of last resort. The
 * daemon binds the first that works (relocating past a capability error); the
 * proxy connects the first that answers. Both walk the SAME list, so they still
 * converge on whichever the daemon bound with zero coordination.
 */
/**
 * Ordered socket / named-pipe path candidates the daemon should try to bind (and
 * the proxy should try to connect) for `projectRoot`, most-preferred first.
 * Deterministic given a project root, so independent processes converge without
 * coordination — even when the preferred candidate is unusable and both fall
 * through to the same fallback.
 *
 *   - Windows: a single named pipe (lives in the kernel pipe namespace, not on
 *     the project FS, so neither the length nor the ExFAT hazard applies).
 *   - Short in-project path: `[ .codegraph/daemon.sock , <tmpdir> ]` — try the
 *     project first, fall back to tmpdir if its FS can't host a socket (#997).
 *   - Long in-project path (deep monorepos, Bazel out dirs): `[ <tmpdir> ]` only
 *     — bind would throw ENAMETOOLONG, so we skip straight to tmpdir.
