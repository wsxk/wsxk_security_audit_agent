/**
 * Shared MCP daemon — issue #411.
 *
 * One detached `codegraph serve --mcp` daemon process per project root,
 * accepting N concurrent MCP clients over a Unix-domain socket (or named pipe
 * on Windows). Each incoming connection gets its own {@link MCPSession}; all
 * sessions share a single {@link MCPEngine}, which means a single file watcher
 * (one inotify set), a single SQLite connection (one WAL writer), and a single
 * tree-sitter warm-up — paid once, amortized across every agent talking to the
 * project.
 *
 * Lifecycle (see also `./index.ts` and `./proxy.ts`):
 *   - The daemon is spawned **detached** (its own session/process group, stdio
 *     decoupled) by the first launcher that finds no daemon running. It is NOT
 *     a child of any MCP host, so closing one terminal / Ctrl-C'ing one session
 *     can't take it down and sever the others. That's why this process has no
 *     PPID watchdog: it deliberately outlives every individual client.
 *   - Every MCP host talks to the daemon through a thin `proxy` process (the
 *     thing the host actually spawned). The proxy keeps the #277 PPID watchdog,
 *     so a SIGKILL'd host still reaps its proxy promptly; the proxy's socket
 *     close then decrements the daemon's refcount.
 *   - When the last client disconnects the daemon lingers for
 *     `CODEGRAPH_DAEMON_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 300s) so back-to-back agent
 *     runs in the same project don't repay startup, then exits cleanly. This is
 *     what keeps a single-agent session from leaking a daemon forever (#277).
 *
 * What this file owns:
 *   - Listening on the daemon socket and spawning per-connection sessions.
 *   - The handshake "hello" line that lets a proxy verify it found a
 *     same-version daemon before piping any JSON-RPC through it.
 *   - The lockfile (`.codegraph/daemon.pid`) competing daemons arbitrate
 *     against — atomic `O_EXCL` create with the full record written in the same
 *     breath (no empty-file window) + cleanup on exit.
 *   - Reference counting + idle timeout.
 *   - Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT and idle exit.
 *
 * What this file does NOT own:
 *   - The proxy side (`./proxy.ts`).
 *   - The decision of *whether* to run as daemon at all — that's `MCPServer`.
 *   - The MCP protocol state machine — that's `./session.ts`.

 *
 * must-fix 1 (issue #411 review): the lockfile must appear in ONE atomic step,
 * already complete — never empty, even momentarily. The first attempt at this
 * (`O_EXCL` create then a separate `writeSync`) left a microsecond window where
 * the file existed but was empty; under concurrent daemon startup a third
 * candidate could read that empty file, decode it as `null`, and `unlink` the
 * winner's lock → two daemons (two watchers, two writers). The window was
 * normally too small to hit, but the file watcher's extra startup time made
 * concurrent daemons overlap enough to reproduce it reliably.
 *
 * The fix writes the complete record to a private temp file, then hard-links it
 * into place: `link()` is atomic AND exclusive (EEXIST if the target exists), so
 * the pidfile becomes visible in one step already containing a full record.
 * Whoever links first wins; everyone else gets EEXIST and reads a complete file.
 * There is no empty-file window at all.
 *
 * Filesystems without hard links (#997): ExFAT/FAT external volumes and some
 * network mounts can't `link()` at all — it throws ENOTSUP/EPERM, which would
 * otherwise kill the daemon before it ever reaches the socket bind. There we
 * fall back to an O_EXCL create (`acquireLockViaExclusiveOpen`): still exclusive
 * ("first writer wins"), but the full record is written through the fd in a
 * second step, so the empty-file window the link approach removed is reopened —
 * only on these filesystems, only for the microseconds between create and write
 * (far narrower than the original bug, which the file watcher's startup latency
 * widened). The race's worst case is two daemons briefly; on a single external
